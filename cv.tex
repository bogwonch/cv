	I am a recently graduate of Bristol University specializing in computer
	security.  I currently work for an Embedded Linux consultency as a
	security engineer.  I work with conditional access vendors to develop
	their Linux and Android security specifications and develop in kernel
	dynamic analysis tools.  I enjoy solving tricky problems with code and
	in university I helped teach problem solving skills to others.  I want
	to continue to develop my understanding of computer and information
	security, developing tools and research in industry and academia and to
	show others just how fascinating security research is.

     \begin{itemize}
       \item[] Specialised in cryptography and security.
       \item[] Won the Infineon Prize for best final year project in Computer Architecture.
       \item[] Wrote thesis on a steganographic method to create architecture independent bytecode.
       Looked at the techniques to find valid instructions on multiple
       architectures, assessed their steganographic properties, and showed how
       a distinguisher could be written for programs using them.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item[] Developed Linux and Android security specifications for conditional access vendors.  
      \item[] Worked to create a dynamic analysis tool for assessing a systems
	      conformance to the security specifications.  Involved writing a
	      kernel module and rootkit to hook into the system under test, and
	      SQL database to implement the tests
      \item[] Updating a set-top box system to a more modern kernel.  Rewrote
	      BSP to support new kernel; integrated Grsecurity patch set to
	      harden system; helped port their main application from a chroot
	      into an LXC container.

        standards for C++~\&~Visual~Basic inside GE~Oil~and~Gas as well as the
        development of automatic testing equipment for watchdog PLCs.
        Witnessed the testing of several hardware and software
        projects.
      \item[] I was awarded a 2:1 for my year of work and report on the design
        and implementation of automatic test equipment.
