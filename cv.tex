%  I am a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh researching how we can use a logic of authorization to
%  improve the security in mobile ecosystems.  My research looks at how we can
%  write policies, for the devices and stores, that let us automate or
%  guide the decisions making process surrounding them; and model existing
%  informal policies.  I have experience working as a Linux
%  security engineer for the digital television markets where I helped write the
%  Linux and Android specifications for conditional access vendors.  My passion
%  is for cutting edge security research and helping users and developers
%  understand the issues and limitations of the security of their devices.
%  Through my teaching I have helped show others just how cool security research
%  is.
  I am a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh expecting to submit in
	June.  My research looks at using formal languages to model the
	informal policies and trust relationships that surround mobile devices.
	By doing this we were able to make precise comparisons between
	different app stores and mobile OSs, check the extent user's privacy
	preferences matched their behaviour, and find common areas of concern
	in BYOD policies.  My background is in computer security; this has
	given me the opportunities to work in a variety of areas including
	policy languages, system engineering, embedded devices, program
	analysis and testing.  Now I'm coming to the end of my PhD I am looking
	to work on new problems and continue to explore and show others how
	cool security research is.

  \item[] Looked at how authorization logic can be used to model the informal policies surrounding the mobile ecosystem, and describe precisely the differences.  This led to full publications contrasting user's privacy preferences with their app installation habits (AppPAL for Android), and describing precisely the concerns and trust relationships in BYOD policies (Capturing Policies for BYOD).

  \item[] Worked on a dynamic analysis tool for assessing a system's
    conformance to the security specifications.  Helped develop a

    SQL database to implement the tests.  Built test framework to test the tool worked as expected on multiple architectures and OSs.
  \item[] Updated a set-top box system to a more recent kernel. Integrated patches to
    harden system; helped port their main application from a chroot into an LXC container.
