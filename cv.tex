%  I am a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh researching how we can use a logic of authorization to
%  improve the security in mobile ecosystems.  My research looks at how we can
%  write policies, for the devices and stores, that let us automate or
%  guide the decisions making process surrounding them; and model existing
%  informal policies.  I have experience working as a Linux
%  security engineer for the digital television markets where I helped write the
%  Linux and Android specifications for conditional access vendors.  My passion
%  is for cutting edge security research and helping users and developers
%  understand the issues and limitations of the security of their devices.
%  Through my teaching I have helped show others just how cool security research
%  is.
  I am a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh expecting to
submit in June.  My research looks at using
formal languages to model the informal policies and trust
relationships that surround mobile devices.  By doing this we were
able to make precise comparisons between different app stores and
mobile OSs, check the extent user's privacy preferences matched their
behaviour, and find common areas of concern in BYOD policies.  My
background is in computer security; this has given me the
opportunities to work in a variety of areas including policy
languages, system engineering, embedded devices, program analysis and
testing.  Now I'm coming to the end of my PhD I am looking to move
back into industry and start working on new problems and continue to
explore and show other how cool software engineering is.

  \item[] Looked at how authorization logic can be used to model the informal policies surrounding the mobile ecosystem, and describe precisely the differences.  This led to full publications contrasting user's privacy preferences with their app installation habits (AppPAL for Android), and describing precisely the concerns and trust relationships in BYOD policies (Capturing Policies for BYOD).
